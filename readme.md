Sure! Here's a simple `README.md` you can use for your student YAML loader and filter script:

---

```markdown
# Student Data Viewer (YAML)

This Python project loads student data from a YAML file, displays all students, and allows filtering based on GPA.

## 📁 Files

- `main.py`: The main Python script to load, display, and filter students.
- `students.yaml`: The YAML file containing student data.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `PyYAML` library

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure `students.yaml` is in the same directory as `main.py`.

2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. You'll see a list of all students, then be prompted to enter a minimum GPA to filter the results.

## 🧪 Sample `students.yaml`

```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
